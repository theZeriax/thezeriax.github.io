  <p>
    Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm zeriax, a young developer from Helsinki, Finland. I like
    imagining things and try my best to improve my skills.
  </p>
  <p>
    I really enjoy programming at my free time! I started my (kind of) full-time
    journey in July 2021, though I already knew some HTML back in 2017.

    like it!
